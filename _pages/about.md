I am a PhD Candidate at University of Michigan. My current research is on degradation diagnostics and fault detection of lithium-ion battery systems connected to the grid. My research interest lies in the intersection of batteries, data science, and and machine learning, where I am accelerating the development and deployment of batteries. 

Here, you can find more information about my work and my blog where I often post about batteries, data science, and machine learning. 

You can also find personal information about me, particularly my passion for endurance sports.
