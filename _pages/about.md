Welcome to my website! Please check out ways to reach me as well as my various other homes on the web in the menu (either to the left or above, depending on your screen resolution) and click the links at the top of the page to check out some of my experience and work!

I'm a computational scientist (with significant previous experimental experience), currently a Materials Science PhD candidate in the MIT Photovoltaics Research Laboratory working on materials discovery for solar cell absorbers. In particular, I perform first-principles simulations to understand defect physics in these materials as well as high-throughput device level simulations to use Bayesian inference along with experimental data to more quickly and accurately measure fundamental materials properties. I've developed an open-source code for this project, [bayesim](https://pv-lab.github.io/bayesim/_build/html/index.html), and am always keen to find new users!

You can download a CV [here](/files/CVKurchin.pdf).


About this site
===============

This website is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub Pages. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
