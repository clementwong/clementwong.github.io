I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Michigan. My current research focuses on degradation diagnostics and fault detection in lithium-ion battery systems connected to the grid. My research interests lie at the intersection of batteries, machine learning, and data science, where I aim to improve the development, operations, and safety of batteries. 

More information about me and my work will be posted soon!
