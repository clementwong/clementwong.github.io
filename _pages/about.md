I am a PhD Candidate at University of Michigan. My current research is on degradation diagnostics and fault detection of lithium-ion battery systems connected to the grid. My research interest lies in the intersection of batteries, data science, and and machine learning, where I am working improving the operations and safety of batteries. 

More information about me and my work will be posted soon!
