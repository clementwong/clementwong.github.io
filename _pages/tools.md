Even though we don't work in a laboratory, computationalists use many tools that make our lives easier and more convenient every day! I want to highlight some (especially those that exist thanks to the uncompensanted efforts of open-source developers) here, to provide some acknowledgement to those developers and also in case you're looking for a tool to do something similar, or do it better!

I'm also always keen to learn new tools, so if you think you can improve my workflows, [give me a shout!](rkurchin@cmu.edu)

Progamming Languages
--------------------

My most fluent programming at the moment is [Python](https://www.python.org), although I'm working on learning [Julia](https://www.julialang.org)!

I use a lot of different Python packages too. For data-wrangling, I couldn't live without [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) or the rest of the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org) ecosystem, especially NumPy for mathy things and matplotlib for visualization. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) is another great visualization package built on top of matplotlib. For simple parallelization tasks, [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) makes life a lot easier. And for interacting with HDF5 files super simply, [deepdish](https://deepdish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (sadly no longer maintained) is also pretty great.

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a great and near-ubiquitous version-control system. I'm at a pretty basic level of git competency, and like many people, I also use [GitHub](https://www.github.com).

Programming Environments
------------------------

For interactive testing of Julia and Python code with inline output, I'm an extensive user of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org). [Binder](https://www.mybinder.org) is a related useful tool that lets you spin up Jupyter kernels from git repos in the cloud!

I learned about [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) from my amazing friend and mentor [Prashun](https://www.prashungorai.org/) and never looked back. Just a super reliable, customizable terminal app. I particularly love their Minimal theme and status bar customization options in the latest release!

When I'm editing code on a cluster, I'm a very-much-not-power-user of Emacs, but when I'm able to edit locally, I love love love [Atom](https://atom.io). Super nice-looking out of the box but nearly infinitely customizable with extensions for every possible need! The extensions I use include 

Academic Life
-------------

I manage my citations with [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com). I don't love that they're owned by Elsevier now so I'd love recommendations for your favorite alternatives. I tried ReadCube for awhile a few years ago but despite a cool feature set, I found it rather buggy.

I recently switched over to [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com) as my email client.
