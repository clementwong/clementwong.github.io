I served as a teaching assistant to the first-year graduate course 3.23: *Electronic, Optical, and Magnetic Properties of Materials*, taught by Prof. Geoffrey Beach. Responsibilities included writing problem sets and solutions, giving recitation lectures, and holding office hours and exam review sessions.

I also baked thematic treats for the students on exam days, with the crowning glory being h(oney)-bars for the final exam!

Excerpts from Student Evaluations
---------------------------------
> Really appreciate all she did to help us learn - very understanding, responsive, and good at answering questions.

> A great TA. Rachel showed genuine interest in making sure that we understood the material. She also was really good at listening to our questions, stopping to think about what we may not be understanding and the proceeding really resolve the misunderstanding. She was over all a wonderful TA and this class would have been much more difficult without her.

> Awesome at explaining tricky concepts, predicting points of confusion, and being patient and approachable! 10/10 on her baking skills as well :)

> The best TA ever. She cares and tries to help; and she is very good at it.
